## 🌐 Your Live Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:

**https://myrarafiq.github.io/UpNext**

---

## ⚙️ What Was Configured

✅ **vite.config.js** - Added `base: '/UpNext/'`
✅ **package.json** - Added deploy scripts and homepage
✅ **gh-pages** - Installed deployment package
✅ **.nojekyll** - Added to prevent Jekyll processing
✅ **Built** - Production build created in `dist/`

---

## 🔧 Manual Deploy (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Go to your GitHub repository settings
3. Navigate to: Settings → Pages
4. Source: Deploy from a branch
5. Branch: Select `gh-pages` → `/(root)` → Save

The `gh-pages` branch will be created automatically when you run `npm run deploy`.

---

## 🎯 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment:

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to process
2. Visit: https://myrarafiq.github.io/UpNext
3. Your full app should be live and working!

---

## 🔄 Future Updates

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Commit to git
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main

# 3. Deploy
npm run deploy
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Device not configured" error
**Solution**: You need to authenticate with GitHub. Use a Personal Access Token or GitHub CLI.

### Issue: Blank page after deployment
**Solution**: 
- Make sure `base: '/UpNext/'` is in vite.config.js
- Clear your browser cache
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update

### Issue: 404 errors
**Solution**: The `.nojekyll` file should be in the `public/` folder (already done!)

### Issue: Changes not showing
**Solution**: 
- Run `npm run build` to rebuild
- Run `npm run deploy` to redeploy
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

## 📱 Features That Work on GitHub Pages

✅ All UI components
✅ React routing
✅ LocalStorage (data persistence)
✅ All interactive features
✅ Responsive design
✅ Multi-agent AI logic (client-side)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- ❌ No real backend API calls
- ❌ No server-side authentication
- ❌ LinkedIn/GitHub OAuth won't work (needs backend)
- ❌ SMS/Email notifications won't send (needs backend)

But everything else works perfectly for demo purposes!
